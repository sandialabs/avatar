.Sh FORMATS
.Pp
.Ss AVATAR
.Ar AVATAR
format data consists of two pieces: a
.Ar .data
file and a
.Ar .names
file.
.Pp
The
.Ar .names
file contains the class and attribute specifications.
There is one specification line per column of data in the .data file.
The specifications are of the form:
.Pp
.Dl "[label] : continuous"
.Dl "[label] : discrete value,value,value"
.Dl "[label] : class value,value,value"
.Pp
.Ar label
is an optional string label for the attribute or class. The attribute type is either
.Ar continuous
or
.Ar discrete .
Discrete attributes take on one of a finite set of values. The values are
listed after the discrete keyword in a comma-separated list.
As with the discrete attributes, the
.Ar class
specification line contains a comma-separated list of valid class values.
.Pp
The
.Ar .data
file contains the value of each attribute for each sample. The file
may contain an optional comment line containing the attribute labels. If specified,
these labels must match the labels as specified in the
.Ar .names
file.
The data follows, one data point per line with the attribute values separated by commas.
The truth class column can be anywhere and is specified on the command line with the
.Fl -truth-column
option. By default, the truth column is the last column in the file.
.Pp
The
.Ar .test
file follows the same conventions as the
.Ar .data
file. "Unlabeled" data may be used in the
.Ar .test
file if
.Fl -output-accuracies
and
.Fl --output-confusion-matrix
is not specified on the command line. Unlabeled data is data with the class set to
a value not specified as a class value in the
.Ar .names
file or set to a blank or NULL value (i.e. no value).
.Pp
.Ss EXODUS CLASS CONFIGURATION
This file contains the exodus variable to be used as the class definition and information
to extract the classes from the variable data. If the class variables is specified
in the class configuration file, it need not be specified on the command line via the
.Fl -class-var
option. A sample class config file is:
.Pp
.Dl "class_var_name Osaliency"
.Dl "number_of_classes 5"
.Dl "thresholds 0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8"
.Pp
The
.Ar thresholds
are used to split up the variable into classes. In the above example, class 0
will contain all points for which the class variable is <=0.2; class 1 will
contain all points for which the class variable is <=0.4; and so on.
