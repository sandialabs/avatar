.Ar foo.ex2 
and the ensemble is written to/read from
.Ar foo.trees .

.Ar bar.names
is used for the class and attribute definition file,

WITH the
.Fl -partitions
option:
.Pp
For training on
.Ar exodus
format data, the
.Fl -datafile
option is ignored and the data is read from the exodus files
listed in the partitions file and each partition's ensemble is
written to a 
.Ar .trees
file following the naming convention above.
For testing on
.Ar exodus
format data, the testing data is taken from the file named by the
.Fl -datafile
argument and the ensembles are read from the
.Ar .trees
files associated with the exodus files listed in the partitions file.
.Pp
For training on
.Ar avatar
format data, the data is read from the files listed in the partitions file.
The
.Ar .names
file is taken from the
.Fl -filestem
argument if given or else from the first file in the partitions file with 
.Ar .names
substituted for
.Ar .data .
