Avatar requires fclib and can be build with or without exodus.
Both fclib and exodus are in the util directory.
Compile fclib with/without exodus and then compile avatar with/without exodus.
As with fclib, modify the Makefile.include file for your system and then run

make install

To install the MPI version of the avatar tools run

make install USE_MPI=yes

Relevant configuration variables are:

HAVE_EXODUS
HAVE_LIBXML2
LIBXML2CONFIG
IS_GNU (If your getopt handles long options, IS_GNU=yes. Otherwise IS_GNU=no.)
FCLIB_HOME
NETCDF_HOME (if compiling with exodus)
EXODUS_HOME (if compiling with exodus)
INSTALL_DIR
MPI_HOME

For both fclib and avatar, make sure HAVE_SAF=no and then don't worry about
SAF_HOME or HDF5_HOME
