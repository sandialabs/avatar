ADDED FEATURES:

The installation process is now
./configure && make && make install

Added the --verbose-oob option to avatardt. This generates a new file
(default is basename.oob-data) containing the OOB error as each new
tree is added to the ensemble. Requires that either bagging or ivoting
be turned on.

Added the --version option which does what you may expect.

You can now specify alternate filenames for input/output instead of
being forced to use the same basename for all. See the --train-data
option and others like it in the usage message or manpage.

The overall voted accuracy is printed when running crossvalfc even
when the confusion matrix is not requested.

BUG FIXES:

Fixed an --include bug that manifests when truth is column 1 and you
want to include above column 2.

Fixed a crash when reading some trees due to memory problems.

Fixed a problem with empty files specified as training/testing data.
The code now alerts you to this fact and quits instead of crashing.

Fixed a bug that didn't like some comment lines in the training/
testing data.

OTHER:

The version is now integrated with the latest FCLib release (1.6.1)
which has had all SAF references removed. It is also integrated with
the latest ExodusII open source release (4.61).
